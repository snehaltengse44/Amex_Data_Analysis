Data Analysis for Large-Scale Data | Machine Learning | Python

Executed end-to-end feature engineering processes, including handling missing data, addressing outliers, scaling
features using standardization, constructing new features, and extracting meaningful attributes.

Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, logistic
regression, and SVM. The analysis led to the identification of the algorithm that best predicts the desired output.

Generated actionable insights through the use of predictive models, which contributed to the enhancement of
decision-making processes in customer profiling and risk assessment strategies.
